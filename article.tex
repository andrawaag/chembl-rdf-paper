\section{Introduction}\label{s1}

Despite the data deluge, finding new, unique, but significant patterns explaining biological
phenomena not yet understood is limited by the availability of data. Such data analysis is
beyond the scope of single data sets; it requires data integration from many sources, for
example, systems biology integrating micro-array differential expression to biological
pathways~\cite{}. Another prominent example is drug discovery where a new unique chemical entity is
searched with just the right biological properties. This too requires linking many
data sets~\cite{Samwald2011,OpenPHACTS}.

AJW> CIte here the Open PHACTS paper submitted next week: Open PHACTS: Semantic interoperability for drug discovery
Antony J. Williams, Lee Harland, Paul Groth, Stephen Pettifer, Christine Chichester, Egon L. Willighagen, Chris T. Evelo, Niklas Blomberg, Gerhard Ecker, Carole Goble and Barend Mons, Drug Disc. Today. Submitted for publication. Hopefully reviewed and with DOI available by the time this article is accepted.


ChEMBL contains biological activities for over a million chemical entities, extracted from
literature, providing a unique resource for drug discovers~\cite{Gaulton2012,Warr2009}. It is updated on a fairly frequent basis as the existing data is further curated and new data is added. Originally, this
data was available for download and via a web interface. The former requires setting up
the data in a relational database, while the latter limits the machine access to the data.
Two independent teams created RDF triples for the ChEMBL data, resulting in exposure
via Chem2Bio2RDF~\cite{Chen2010} and ChEMBL-RDF~\cite{Willighagen2011}.

This paper presents the history of the ChEMBL-RDF data set, details of the latest structures
and ontologies used for the RDF version of ChEMBL 13, and a few new example use cases,
exemplifying how the data set can be linked to other data sources to further support
research in the life sciences.

\section{Methods}\label{s2}

The ChEMBL version used in this paper is ChEMBL 13, which was released on 29 February 2012.
RDF triples were created from a local MySQL database to which the SQL data dump of ChEMBL was
inserted, using a PHP script, available from the source code hosting service
GitHub~\citep{ChEMBLRDFGitHub}, a process outlined earlier in a best practices note by
the international Health Care and Life Sciences XXX Working Group~\cite{Marshall2012}.

During the life time of this project, the ontologies used in ChEMBL-RDF have changed,
initially using a custom, ad-hoc ontology, but increasingly with community-proposed
ontologies, making the RDF more interoperable. The ChEMBL-RDF 13 dataset uses ontology
standards such as the Bibliography Ontology for Citation Typing Ontology for literature
references, and domain ontologies like the Protein Ontology and the Chemical Information
Ontology. Throughout this paper, various prefixes are used to simplify the RDF output and they are outlined
in Table~\ref{namespaces}.

\begin{table*}

\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

To expose that ChEMBL-RDF data two approaches have been adopted. First, a SPARQL end point
hosted at Uppsala University, using the Open Source Virtuoso software. Use is free, but the
querying is capped, based on the estimated computational effort. Second, resources have
been made dereferencable using the Kasabi platform. This platform also provides a SPARQL
end point, but requires a user account.

As a method to further test the access and possibilities of this Linked Data version of
ChEMBL, a few new uses cases have been developed for this paper.

\subsection{Data Structure}

For each of the common resource classes a triple pattern was defined, following the
data available in the relational database. ... see Figure~\ref{f1}.

For documents little information is replicated from the database, taking advantage
of PubMed Identifiers (PMIDs) and Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). URIs for the
latter can be resolved online, providing curated information on the identified
documents. For PubMed articles ...

\subsection{SPARQL end points}

Previously, a SPARQL end point has been set up at Uppsala University.

For human-oriented browsing, a SNORQL front-end has been set up, which we
recently updated to have a menu item for superclasses, that is classes
of which subclasses are found in the data, as shown in Figure~\ref{f2}.

\begin{figure}[bt]
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{snorql}
\caption{The SNORQL interface for browsing the SPARQL end point.}\label{f2}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Bio2RDF}

%Peter: write up the proxying... if that still works... It was broken through disuse, but is available again in its rdf.farmbio.uu.se configuration, separately from the bio2rdf-webapp at https://github.com/ansell/chembl-webapp/

The Bio2RDF project provides both resolvable Linked Data URIs using a generic Linked Data
server~\cite{Ansell2011} to access SPARQL endpoints for a range of scientific databases~\cite{Belleau2008}.
A number of these databases are referenced in ChEMBL, including ChEBI, Pubmed, and both the
Uniprot protein and taxonomy databases~\cite{TheUniProtConsortium2010}. These links are
vital to provide context for use cases that require a correlation between chemical
structures and other scientific data. 

The Linked Data server used by Bio2RDF has been reconfigured for ChEMBL to provide URL
based services for standard URI resolution, along with text and link searches
\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ansell/chembl-webapp}}. It proxies the standard item
URIs by translating URLs between those requested by users and the URIs that are available
in the databases. For example, if the ChEMBL web application is running on the users
local machine \footnote{\url{http://localhost:8080/chembl/}}, then a request for the
article with identifier ``a31863'' \footnote{\url{http://localhost:8080/chembl/article/a31863}}
will be resolved from the database using the full original URI
\footnote{\url{http://data.kasabi.com/dataset/chembl-rdf/13/activity/a31863}}. If the
user requested an RDF document, using content negotiation, the original URIs will be unchanged,
however, if the user requested an HTML document, the results will contain both the
original RDF triples, represented using RDFa, with links that resolve using the users local machine.

The links services enables the Chembl application to derive both forward links, originating in
ChEMBL \footnote{\url{http://localhost:8080/chembl/linkstonamespace/targetns/originalns:identifier}},
and backward links, originating in other databases, such as LODD, Bio2RDF
\footnote{\url{http://bio2rdf.org/linksns/targetns/originalns:identifier}}, or Chem2Bio2RDF.
These services are vital to efficiently navigate the Linked Data web, as it is both
impractical and inefficient to require users to crawl the web before they can discover all of the
relevant resources. These services are currently only supplied as web services from ChEMBL and
Bio2RDF, but it is hoped that similar services will be provided by other scientific Linked Data
providers in the future. Datasets that are available in SPARQL endpoints can be queried for
links efficiently using templated queries in the ChEMBL web application.

\subsubsection{Data Statistics and Validation}

John/Anna: common statistics with SPARQL

\subsubsection{CitedIn}

Andra: use the SPARQL end point to find which entries in ChEMBL cite what papers
 
The link between data and formal publication is important in many areas of
attribution, scientist ranking, etc, as outline in \cite{Waagmeester2012}.
ChEMBL contains many literature references, and we wish to query this data
for CitedIn.

\subsubsection{Decision Support}

Egon,Antony/Valery,Ola: develop and write up the Bioclipse Decision Support use case

\subsection{Linked Data on Kasabi}

Later, to satisfy the requirements for the Linked Open Drug Data \cite{Samwald2011}
network, the data was also hosted on Kasabi, a triple store hosting service
free for Open Data~\cite{kasabi}.

David: Chem2Bio2RDF

\subsubsection{Linking out to ChemSpider}

Antony: if you can contribute ChemSpider IDs for the ChEMBL compounds ... 
AJW> CC-BY-SA 3.0 licensing approved for the mappings between ChEMBL and ChemSpider. Please use the Open PHACTS data provided and attribution to ChEMBL, OPS and ChemSPider.

\subsubsection{Linking out to ChEMBL}
Peter: write up the proxying... if that still works...


John/Anna: I can easily add links to webpages using foaf:homepage... are webpage URLs for entities stable enough?

\subsubsection{Linking out to Bio2RDF}

Peter/Egon: write up links to Bio2RDF for protein, pubmed, ...
