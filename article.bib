  abstract = {Scientists need to transfer semantically similar queries across multiple
	heterogeneous linked datasets. These queries may require data from
	different locations and the results are not simple to combine due
	to differences between datasets. A query model was developed to make
	it simple to distribute queries across different datasets using RDF
	as the result format. The query model, based on the concept of publicly
	recognised namespaces for parts of each scientific dataset, was implemented
	with a configuration that includes a large number of current biological
	and chemical datasets. The configuration is flexible, providing the
	ability to transparently use both private and public datasets in
	any query. A prototype implementation of the model was used to resolve
	queries for the Bio2RDF website, including both Bio2RDF datasets
	and other datasets that do not follow the Bio2RDF URI conventions.},

  abstract = {Presently, there are numerous bioinformatics databases available on
	different websites. Although RDF was proposed as a standard format
	for the web, these databases are still available in various formats.
	With the increasing popularity of the semantic web technologies and
	the ever growing number of databases in bioinformatics, there is
	a pressing need to develop mashup systems to help the process of
	bioinformatics knowledge integration. Bio2RDF is such a system, built
	from rdfizer programs written in JSP, the Sesame open source triplestore
	technology and an OWL ontology. With Bio2RDF, documents from public
	bioinformatics databases such as Kegg, PDB, MGI, HGNC and several
	of NCBI's databases can now be made available in RDF format through
	a unique URL in the form of http://bio2rdf.org/namespace:id. The
	Bio2RDF project has successfully applied the semantic web technology
	to publicly available databases by creating a knowledge space of
	RDF documents linked together with normalized URIs and sharing a
	common ontology. Bio2RDF is based on a three-step approach to build
	mashups of bioinformatics data. The present article details this
	new approach and illustrates the building of a mashup used to explore
	the implication of four transcription factor genes in Parkinson's
	disease. The Bio2RDF repository can be queried at http://bio2rdf.org.},

  abstract = {Cheminformatics is the application of informatics techniques to solve
	chemical problems in silico. There are many areas in biology where
	cheminformatics plays an important role in computational research,
	including metabolism, proteomics, and systems biology. One critical
	aspect in the application of cheminformatics in these fields is the
	accurate exchange of data, which is increasingly accomplished through
	the use of ontologies. Ontologies are formal representations of objects
	and their properties using a logic-based ontology language. Many
	such ontologies are currently being developed to represent objects
	across all the domains of science. Ontologies enable the definition,
	classification, and support for querying objects in a particular
	domain, enabling intelligent computer applications to be built which
	support the work of scientists both within the domain of interest
	and across interrelated neighbouring domains. Modern chemical research
	relies on computational techniques to filter and organise data to
	maximise research productivity. The objects which are manipulated
	in these algorithms and procedures, as well as the algorithms and
	procedures themselves, enjoy a kind of virtual life within computers.
	We will call these information entities. Here, we describe our work
	in developing an ontology of chemical information entities, with
	a primary focus on data-driven research and the integration of calculated
	properties (descriptors) of chemical entities within a semantic web
	context. Our ontology distinguishes algorithmic, or procedural information
	from declarative, or factual information, and renders of particular
	importance the annotation of provenance to calculated data. The Chemical
	Information Ontology is being developed as an open collaborative
	project. More details, together with a downloadable {OWL} file, are
	available at http://code.google.com/p/semanticchemistâ€‹ry/ (license:
	{CC}-{BY}-{SA}).},

	their way into the life sciences. Ontologies and semantic markup
	have already been used for more than a decade in molecular sciences,
	but have not found widespread use yet. The semantic web technology
	Resource Description Framework ({RDF}) and related methods show to
	be sufficiently versatile to change that situation. {RESULTS} : The
	work presented here focuses on linking {RDF} approaches to existing
	molecular chemometrics fields, including cheminformatics, {QSAR}
	modeling and proteochemometrics. Applications are presented that
	link {RDF} technologies to methods from statistics and cheminformatics,
	including data aggregation, visualization, chemical identification,
	and property prediction. They demonstrate how this can be done using
	various existing {RDF} standards and cheminformatics libraries. For
	example, we show how {IC50} and Ki values are modeled for a number
	of biological targets using data from the {ChEMBL} database. {CONCLUSIONS}
	: We have shown that existing {RDF} standards can suitably be integrated
	into existing molecular chemometrics methods. Platforms that unite
	these technologies, like Bioclipse, makes this even simpler and more
	transparent. Being able to create and share workflows that integrate
	data aggregation and analysis (visual and statistical) is beneficial
	to interoperability and reproducibility. The current work shows that
	{RDF} approaches are sufficiently powerful to support molecular chemometrics
	workflows.},
